In your warehouse operations, the inbound process is a critical component that sets the stage for efficient order fulfilment. At Leanafy, we understand the significance of a well-optimized inbound operation, where the primary focus is on reducing workload and maximizing productivity. 

Understanding the Inbound Operation Workflow
To initiate the inbound process, you should begin by generating License Plate Identifiers (which can be pallets, barrels, boxes etc.). It's essential to ensure that you have a sufficient number of License Plate Identifiers available whenever you are preparing to receive items against the Advance Receipt Notice (ARN). The next step involves creating an ARN for the client from whom you'll be receiving items in your warehouse. Afterwards, you can assign the ARN to a designated warehouse user and commence the receiving process. Following thorough inspection and validation, you can proceed to fulfil the ARN, completing the inbound process efficiently and accurately.

The ARN undergoes various phases, and with each of these stages, distinct capabilities become accessible within the ARN.

Open

Your client will notify you in advance about the impending arrival of item(s) at the warehouse. In response, you'll create an Advance Receipt Notice (ARN) to inform Leanafy about the list of items you're expecting. This ARN status remains "Open" until the actual receiving process is initiated against it, indicating that the items have begun their journey into your inventory.

Receiving

Once the items have arrived at your warehouse for the client, and you've initiated the receiving process, the status is promptly updated to "Receiving." This indicates that the goods are in the process of being logged into inventory and prepared for further handling or distribution.

Closed

Once all the items listed in the Advance Receipt Notice (ARN) have been successfully received and processed, and you have fulfilled the ARN, the status will be updated to "Closed." This change in status signifies the completion of the receiving process for the specified items for that client. This will remove that ARN from your "ARNs" page view, you can choose to view all closed ARNs by selecting the "Closed" status from the filters. 

Cancelled

If you mark an ARN as cancelled, for whatever reason you might deem necessary then it will be removed from your "ARNs" page, you can still view these cancelled ARNs by explicitly setting the status in the filter to "Cancelled". 



Now that you know all the basic information about Inbound ops in Leanafy It's time to go through the flow.

Generating License Plate Identifiers 
Generating License Plate Identifiers is the initial step in the inbound operation process. A License Plate(LP) Identifier  is a unique code that is assigned to each container of goods. This identifier helps in tracking and managing inventory efficiently within the warehouse. 

Creating an ARN (Advance Receipt Notice)
Creating an Advance Receipt Notice (ARN) is a crucial step in preparing for the incoming inventory. An ARN serves as a formal notification of an expected shipment. In this step, you have two options:

Creating ARN: This involves generating a basic notification for the warehouse regarding an incoming shipment. It includes essential details such as the expected quantity of items along with their respective units of measurement (UoM).

Creating ARN with Source Information: When creating an ARN with source information, you have the option to provide more comprehensive tracking and processing details. This enables you to specify information such as the supplier's name, the anticipated date for receiving items in the ARN, PRN (Primary Reference Number), any other special instructions and more.

Assigning an ARN
After creating an ARN, the next step is to assign it to a specific warehouse user to handle the incoming shipment. Assigning an ARN ensures that the warehouse knows who is accountable for receiving and processing the inventory. 

Receiving items against the ARN 
Once you've created the ARN (Advance Receipt Notice) and you're ready to receive items in the warehouse, you can start the receiving process by entering the received quantity of the item and you can receive them in two ways:

- Receive them as an individual loose item directly at the receiving location.                                              - Or receive them on a License Plate (LP) at that receiving location.

Once you've received all the items, you can then complete the receiving process by fulfilling the ARN.

Printing an ARN
Printing an ARN is essential for maintaining accurate records and documentation. Once an ARN is created or updated, it can be printed. This ensures that everyone involved in the inbound operation has access to the necessary information, and it helps in tracking and organizing inventory effectively.



Generating a GRN for a Fulfilled ARN
Generating a GRN (Goods Receipt Note) is the final step in the process for a fulfilled ARN. The GRN serves as proof of receipt of goods and completion of the ARN. The documentation linked below provides detailed instructions on how to generate a GRN.
