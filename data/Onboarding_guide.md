Welcome to Leanafy! We're thrilled to have you. Our onboarding guide will be your trusted companion, offering all the help you need to get started and more. Let's embark on this journey together!



Step 1: Logging into the Leanafy

Step 2: Setting up Access Profiles 
Now the first after logging in would be to add your team to Leanafy. But before that, you should define the different roles that you have in your warehouse and decide on what permission these roles will require. This mapping of Roles with permission is called "Access profile" in Leanafy. You will be able to attach this access profile with multiple users to give them the same level of permission for the same role. 

For example, you can create a role called "picker" and give them access to only Picking permissions. Then at the time of adding a user, you can select this access profile to give all your pickers the same level of access instead of selecting the same permissions for each individual user over and over again. Follow these steps to create a new access profile:

Step 3: Adding a Warehouse User
After successfully setting up a new access profile, your next step is to onboard people from your team who will perform warehouse operations. All you need to do is provide their details like Name and email  and assign the relevant access profile. This way, they will have permissions aligned with their role, enabling them to carry out authorized actions seamlessly. Follow the steps outlined here - 

Step 4: Adding Clients to a Warehouse 
Now that you've added a user, the next step is to start adding your clients in the warehouse.

Step 5: Adding Units of Measurement 
Unit of Measurement (UoM) is the unit associated with your products. For warehouses, the same product (SKU) can be measured differently. For example, an "Avengers T-shirt" comes to your warehouse in boxes of 10, you store it on pallets within your warehouse and you get orders for the same T-shirt in eaches. So there are multiple units to measure a product. But all these UoMs are connected. So we implemented a way for you to track your inventory and manage it in different units depending on your use case for each item. 

First, identify the base unit for your item, which is generally the smallest unit possible for your SKU. Like eaches here in this case. Then you have to provide the information of the other units relative to this base unit. 

10 eaches  -  makes  -  1 Box 

100 eaches (10 boxes) -  makes - 1 Pallet 

This configuration isn't specific to just one SKU (Avengers T-shirt); it might be the same for all the t-shirts of the brand. Hence, we allow creating a UoM (Unit of Measure) as a class which can be applied to multiple SKUs of the same type (other t-shirts). For example, the Iron Man T-shirt would have the same UoM structure. So, while adding the Iron Man T-shirt, you can select the same UoM class name as the Avengers T-shirt. 

Now that you know how Leanafy handles UoM you can follow the steps below to start creating the UoM that you need for items (SKUs) of your clients by following the step given below:

Step 6: Adding Item Master for Clients 
The Item Master contains information about the items stored in your warehouse for a specific client. To add items to the Item Master for a client, follow these steps:
